# Python_Project2_First_Draft
This is my first draft of project 2. 
You will need a 6 files in order to adequately run the code:

1) The jupyter notebook
2) The fasta file that was used (uploaded here)
3) The four pdb files (uploaded here)

Information about where the files were retreived is within the jupyter notebook markdown sections.
